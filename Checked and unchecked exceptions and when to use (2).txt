checked exception
compile time exeption
happens before runtime exceptions
it is caught by the compiler javac
They must be handled with catch try and throws or the program wont compile only
Eg.IOException, SQLException, FileNotFoundException
Extends 'Exception' class
Use Case üéØ	When the program must handle the exception (e.g., file operations, network issues).


unchecked
runtime exception
happens after compilation
it is caught by JVM
eg. NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException
Extends RuntimeException.
When the exception usually indicates programming errors (e.g., accessing null references, dividing by zero).
